# Hello !

I have created a website for people to use when they need help finding shows to watch. I spend a lot of free time watching tv shows and I wanted to use my knowledge to widen people's horizons of entertainment. I hope you enjoy.

## Git

```
echo "# awesome-sand-quokka" >> README.md
git init
git add README.md
git commit -m "first commit"
git branch -M main
git remote add origin https://github.com/maliarng/awesome-sand-quokka.git
git push -u origin main
```

```
git remote add origin https://github.com/maliarng/awesome-sand-quokka.git
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main
```
