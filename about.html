      About my webpage
    </h1>
    <p>
      I created a webpage about Netflix show reccomendations because during my
      free time I watch a lot of Netflix. I like to watch Netflix since you can
      view other people's experiences and stories. I wanted to create a webpage
      based on Netflix shows to help people broaden their horizon and help them
      find something to watch if they are stuck.
